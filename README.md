# üå± Blockchain-Based Agroforestry Corridor Network

Welcome to a decentralized platform for managing agroforestry corridors across regions! This Web3 project uses the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to coordinate sustainable land use, promote biodiversity through agroforestry (integrating trees with crops or livestock), ensure compliance, and incentivize stakeholders across borders. It tackles real-world issues like soil degradation, fragmented ecosystems, and inefficient cross-border collaboration for sustainable agriculture‚Äîsupporting farmers, ecosystems, and climate goals.

## ‚ú® Features

üå≥ Coordinate agroforestry corridors for sustainable land use  
üí∏ Transparent funding and rewards for farmers and stakeholders  
üì° Immutable monitoring via oracles for compliance and impact tracking  
ü§ù Automated cross-border agreements for seamless collaboration  
üé® Tokenized agroforestry credits as NFTs for trade and incentives  
‚öñÔ∏è Decentralized arbitration for land use disputes  
üó≥Ô∏è Governance DAO for community-driven sustainability decisions  
üö´ Prevent unauthorized land use or non-compliant practices  

## üõ† How It Works

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a transparent, decentralized system for agroforestry corridor management. Stakeholders (e.g., farmers, NGOs, or governments) can establish corridors, monitor compliance, and distribute incentives. All actions are recorded on-chain for trust and immutability.

## Smart Contracts

1. **AgroCorridorRegistry.clar**: Registers agroforestry corridors with details like geographic boundaries, tree-crop combinations, involved regions, and stakeholders. Prevents duplicate registrations and logs events for new corridors.

2. **FarmerRegistry.clar**: Enables farmers to register their land parcels within a corridor, issuing NFTs to represent ownership or participation. Includes functions to update land use while enforcing agroforestry guidelines.

3. **CrossRegionAgreement.clar**: Facilitates multi-party agreements between regions or entities (e.g., neighboring countries). Uses multi-signature logic to automate approvals, enforce sustainable practices, and penalize violations.

4. **SustainabilityFund.clar**: Manages a decentralized funding pool using a SIP-10 fungible token (e.g., $AGRO). Handles contributions, milestone-based distributions, and automated payouts to farmers or maintainers.

5. **EcoMonitoringOracle.clar**: Integrates with oracles to provide real-time data on soil health, tree growth, or biodiversity metrics (e.g., via IoT sensors or satellite imagery). Triggers rewards or alerts based on compliance.

6. **AgroNFT.clar**: Mints NFTs representing agroforestry credits or land commitments. Farmers can stake these for rewards or trade them to transfer responsibilities.

7. **AgroGovernanceDAO.clar**: A DAO for voting on corridor expansions, policy updates, or fund allocations. Uses the $AGRO token for governance weighting and proposal execution.

8. **LandDisputeArbitration.clar**: Resolves disputes (e.g., non-compliant land use) through on-chain arbitration. Stakeholders submit evidence, and resolutions trigger compensations or penalties via the SustainabilityFund.

### For Stakeholders (e.g., NGOs/Governments)

- Register a corridor via AgroCorridorRegistry with regional details and agroforestry plans.  
- Propose agreements in CrossRegionAgreement for multi-region collaboration.  
- Fund the SustainabilityFund and link to EcoMonitoringOracle for data-driven disbursements.  

Your corridor is now live, with automated enforcement and transparency!

### For Farmers

- Register land in FarmerRegistry and mint an AgroNFT.  
- Stake in SustainabilityFund or AgroGovernanceDAO to earn rewards.  
- Follow agroforestry rules monitored by EcoMonitoringOracle‚Äîearn incentives or face penalties via LandDisputeArbitration.

### For Verifiers (e.g., Auditors/NGOs)

- Query AgroCorridorRegistry or FarmerRegistry for corridor details.  
- Use EcoMonitoringOracle to verify compliance (e.g., tree planting or soil health).  
- Engage in AgroGovernanceDAO or LandDisputeArbitration for oversight.

That's it! A decentralized, sustainable agroforestry network for a greener future.
